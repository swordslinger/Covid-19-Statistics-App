# `Summary of Project`

This project goal is to provide information on covid in an easy and digestable package. The home page has information on effects of Covid, we then have a link to the a page for covid protection reccomendations this ties in with another link of ireland that displays with popups of the last 14 days of covid cases. This should help the user understand the "hot spots" of covid cases and where is particular dangerous. Then we have a register an account with this page and our idea was that down the road we can do an email update of each county covid cases every 14 days to the user but we ran out of time for this.
